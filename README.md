## OVERVIEW

This is a native iOS Messenger app, with audio/video calls and realtime chat conversations .


MOTIVATION

Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, which translates to 'self-reliant India' or 'self-sufficient India' is the vision of the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi of making India "a bigger and more important part of the global economy", pursuing policies that are efficient, competitive and resilient, and being self-sustaining and self-generating.
We are influenced by Modiji's Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, which focuses on promoting Indian Application, as the majority of our Indian population has WhatsApp as their primary chatting application.
Even the majority of the application used by the Indian population for chatting is made either in the United States or in Russia.
In the present scenario, India does not have an Application in IOS which is bug-free and provides both chatting and payment features to the user at the same time. So, we decided to build a user-friendly IOS based chatting application with UPI enabled feature in it. 
We are creating this application to provide a better user experience.Our application provides users with rich features, the app delivers an incredible live chat experience, allowing users to share text messages, images, emoticons, stickers, audio and video clips, and other media content. The application also provides audio and video calling features which makes social interaction much easier. The ability to send numerous formats of media files among many friends as well as the capability to create personalized groups make the experience even more exciting. Also, its UPI enabled feature provides users an immediate real-time payment system that helps in instantly transferring the funds between the two bank accounts through a mobile platform.
